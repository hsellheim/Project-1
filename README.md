# Project 1

Allotment gardens in Germany: Disappearance of a modern utopia

Starting point for this project was an exhibition I covered on an allotment garden property that had been torn down to build a furniture store. There I learned about the long and complex history of ‚Schrebergärten‘ in Germany and got curious about whether there were any other instances of demolitions. So I started looking around in reports from regional media and found quite a lot: garden spaces that were replaced by new living quarters, commercial areas or highways. So I wanted to see whether there was any data supporting this feeling of a microcosmos disappearing. 
I looked at the data provided by the biggest allotment garden association in Germany and asked them to provide me a dataset of the development of their member numbers. They couldn’t or wouldn’t give it to me so I selected the data using archive.org and checking their 'About Us' page from 2005 until today. I found a study by the national institute for contruction, city and space research (wild name, I know) on changes in allotment garden culture which were very useful. I found out about a twofold trend: higher demand for rental gardens in big cities, growing vacancies in the countryside.

I used many small data sets so the main work was cleaning and combining them. I compared them to factors such as income and population to show social and historical connection and context.
I found this to be a great opportunity to practice my data cleaning skills. Even though the data sets I used are not huge, I spent quite some time getting them to be usable and by that, I believe I really internalized what I learned in class. I also enjoyed using my new mapping skills by making a map in Datawrapper and then styling it in Illustrator. 
I tried comparing the number of garden with the percentage of public park areas in cities to see if there was anything interesting there but couldn’t find coherent and reliable data. So in the end, I decided to exclude that aspect. I also probably would have spent more time styling the map.
